# assemble-pattern-lab [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-pattern-lab.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-pattern-lab)

> An easier-to-use and more extensible build system for pattern-lab.

This is a fork of [assemble-pattern-lab](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-pattern-lab). It's not meant to be an implementation of [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) as much as it is a different implementation of atomic design.

There are a few differences in how this project handles templates compared to Pattern Lab. Instead of having to namespace partials, like `{{> organisms-latest-posts }}`, and then using a complex regex system for dynamically renaming these partials according to how they are organized in folders, here you can simply use `{{organism 'latest-posts'}}`.

This has several advantages:

* Store your patterns wherever you want them, just tell Assemble where they are.
* We're adhering to mustache/handlebars conventions instead of working around them.
* We can easily extend and add new patterns, or allow metadata to be passed as context to templates and so on.


## Getting Started
### Download Options

* Either [download the project]({https://github.com/assemble/assemble-pattern-lab/archive/master.zip}) from GitHub, or
* Use git to clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/assemble/assemble-pattern-lab.git`

### Install dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies, including Assemble and Grunt:

```bash
npm i
```

### Build

With everything downloaded and installed, build the project by running:

```bash
grunt assemble
```

## Usage
The following patterns have been implements:

* `atoms`: used in templates with `{{atoms "foo"}}`
* `molecules`: used in templates with `{{molecules "foo"}}`
* `organisms`: used in templates with `{{organisms "foo"}}`
* `templates`: used in templates with `{{templates "foo"}}`
* `pages`: Pages are specified using `src` property or `files` object/arrays in the Gruntfile config (see below)

For any templates to actually be found during the build, you'll have to first tell Assemble where to find them in Gruntfile, like so:

```js
assemble: {
  options: {
    // Pattern Lab templates
    patterns: {
      atoms: ['src/atoms/**/*.hbs'],
      molecules: ['src/molecules/**/*.hbs'],
      organisms: ['src/organisms/**/*.hbs'],
      templates: ['src/templates/**/*.hbs'],
    }
  },
  site: {

    // `pages` are defined here (you can use any of the Grunt files
    // patterns, e.g. src-dest, files object, files array, etc)
    files: {
      '_gh_pages/': ['src/pages/*.hbs']
    }
  }
}
```

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome! If you like the project, _stars and tweets_ are a great way to show your support. If you want to take a more active role and help with documentation, writing unit tests, addressing issues or whatever seems interesting, please let us know, we'd be happy to help you get started!

Also, we use [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) for documentation, so don't edit the readme or other docs directly. Please edit the templates in the [docs directory](./docs) and then run `verb` to build them before you do a pull request. Thanks!
